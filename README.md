#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is the creation of software systems by applyig engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.
Importances include;
1.Ensures quality and reliable software since structured development is followed thus reducing bugs.
2.Enables Innovation  since it leads to development of and advancements in various industries such as healthcare and finance.
3.Improves efficiency since it leads to streamlining of workflows with automations.
4.supports bussiness growth by helping companies build scalable applications to handle increasing data and users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering
1. Introduction of High-level programming languages which marked a significant shift from manual coding, where programmers wrote machine-level instructions directly.
2. The transition to a more formalized and structured approach, with a focus on using established processes to ensure the quality and reliability of software systems.
3. The advent of object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software development by  introducing modular and reusable code,significantly improving code quality and productivity


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning- Helps with coming up with the budget, identifying risks, defining the scope, objective and feasibility of a project.
2.System design - helps to decide on the overall structure  and components of the software.
3.System development - This is the actual coding and building of the system based on the design specifications. There is use of version control on GIT and developers follow the best practices, frameworks and coding standards.
4.Testing - Identifies errors, bugs and vulnerabilities. Also ensures software meets quality standards before deployment.
5. Deployment - Is the release of the software to production environments.
6. Maintenance and support - Provides updates, patches and bug fixes. Also enhances performance and security overtime.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
